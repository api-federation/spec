# Location for spec

## The aim of this group is to create vendor-neutral open specifications that enable API federation.

'Federation of APIs' or 'API Federation' involves creating systems where API consumers and API producers are not directly connected and do not need to directly trust each other.

The discussion group is https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/api-federation

There are bi-weekly community meetings announced in the google groups.
